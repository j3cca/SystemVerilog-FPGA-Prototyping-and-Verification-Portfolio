# 4-Bit Greater Than Comparator
## Project Overview
**Description:** This project consists of a 4-bit greater-than comparator written in RTL using only gate-level logical operators. The 4-bit greater-than comparator accepts two 4-bit inputs and outputs 1 if input A is greater than B, and 0 if A is not greater than B. 

The 4-bit comparator is composed of two 2-bit greater-than comparator modules and one 2-bit equal-to module joined using a minimal number of logic gates. 

Each module was verified with a self-checking testbench that iterated through all possible input combinations to ensure rigorous correctness.

The bitfile was flashed to a CMOD S7 FPGA board. To interface with the FPGA, 8 DIP-switches were wired to accept the inputs and an external LED was wired to output the result.

> *The 4-bit greater-than comparator accepts two 4-bit inputs (called A and B). The most significant bits of the inputs are fed into both the MSB greater-than comparator and the MSB equal-to comparator. The least significant bits of the inputs are fed into the LSB greater-than comparator.*

> *The outputs of these comparators are joined with glue logic, outputting from the 4-bit module a 1 if A is greater than B, and 0 if A is not greater than B.* 

## Simulation
**Verification Summary:** To verify the functionality of each module, self-checking testbenches were constructed using for-loops to iterate through all possible input combinations, ensuring rigorous correctness. For troubleshooting, $display statements printed the inputs and outputs of each test and whether it passed or failed.
